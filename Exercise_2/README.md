# Friday 13th Detector

This is a simple program written in Python that checks if there is a Friday the 13th in the given month and year. The `exits_friday_13()` function I used takes the year and month as arguments and displays in the console whether the month has a Friday the 13th or not.

## How to use the program

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.

2. Download the `Friday_13th.py` file from this repository.

3. Open a command line and navigate to the location of the `Friday_13th.py` file.

4. Run the program by typing the following command in the command line:

   ```
   python Friday_13th.py
   ```

5. You will be prompted to enter the year and month to check if there is a Friday the 13th. Enter the requested values.

6. The program will display in the console whether the month has a Friday the 13th or not.

Have fun checking if there is a Friday the 13th in any month and year you want!
