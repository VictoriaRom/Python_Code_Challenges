# Hogwarts Sorting Hat

This program simulates the behavior of the Sorting Hat from the Harry Potter magical universe. You'll be able to feel like you're at Hogwarts as the hat selects your house.

## Program Features

- The program asks at least 5 questions through the terminal.
- Each question has 4 options for you to choose from (and you select them through the terminal, of course).
- Based on your answers, the algorithm assigns you to one of the 4 Hogwarts houses: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw.
- The characteristics of each house are taken into account to create the questions and define the sorting algorithm.

## How to Use the Program

1. Run the program:

   ```
   python sorting_hat.py
   ```

2. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to answer the questions.

3. Once you have answered all the questions, the program will tell you which house you belong to.
