# FizzBuzz

This is a simple program that prints numbers from 1 to 100, following the rules of the FizzBuzz game. The `fizzbuzz()` function iterates over the numbers and displays the following transformations in the console:

- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it prints "fizzbuzz".
- If the number is divisible only by 3, it prints "fizz".
- If the number is divisible only by 5, it prints "buzz".
- If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, it prints the number itself.

## How to use the program

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Download the `fizzbuzz.py` file from this repository.
3. Open a command line and navigate to the location of the `fizzbuzz.py` file.
4. Run the program by typing the following command in the command line:

   ```

   ```

5. You will see the program printing numbers from 1 to 100, applying the FizzBuzz rules.
